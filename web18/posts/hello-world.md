# Hello, World 👋

Thanks for checking out my new **Markdown blog**. It's built with vanilla **HTML/CSS/JS**, `marked` for parsing, and `highlight.js` for code blocks.

## Why this stack?

- No build step
- Static hosting friendly
- Easy to write posts in Markdown

> “The secret to getting ahead is getting started.”

### Roadmap

- [x] Post list & router
- [x] Dark mode
- [ ] RSS feed
- [ ] Tags page
- [ ] Comments (static-friendly)

Enjoy!
